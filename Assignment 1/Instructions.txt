Use only the Python concepts/techniques covered to date.

Assignment 1 Requirements
Name your program asgn1_yourlastname.py  (obviously, replace "yourlastname" with your last name!)
 
Code and Test a Python program that will... 

1. Display "Assignment 1" as the first line and then skip a line.

2. Prompt the user for their name, age, and number of hours they sleep and store their answers in program variables

3. Use the following mathematical formula to determine how many years of their life have been wasted sleeping...

       wasted_years = (hours_slept/24) * users_age

4. Format a String message that is in a format similar to what's shown below and display it on the Console.  This example shows what would display if I entered "Steve" for the name, 54 for the age, and 8 for the hours I sleep at night.  Your program must work for ANY name, age, or hours slept numbers entered by the user.

          Hello Steve.
          You have been unconscious for 18.0 years!

(Note:  Do not round the result, you will learn how to do that later.)

5.  Make sure that the period appears directly after the name in the display!  (Must be "Hello Steve.", not "Hello Steve .")

Code and Test a Python program that ...

... displays "* * The Wizard Game * *" and then asks the user "How many Questions do you want to ask the Wizard?  
If the users entered a valid value, then call an "processQuestions" function and send it the integer value for the number they entered in response to the question, 
otherwise display a message that says, "That's not a number.  The Wizard wants you to go away now!" and end the program displaying "END OF PROGRAM" 

The "processQuestions" function should repetitively ask the user "What's your question?".  
Note:  
You are required to use a for-loop for this!  If the user enters "bye" stop the loop and end the program displaying "END OF PROGRAM", 
otherwise call a "getAnswer" function sending it the answer that the user entered in response to the "What's your question?" prompt.  
Data will be sent back from the "getAnswer" function that contains the message that you then display to the user.  
Number the display of the Wizard answers. If the for-loop reaches the maximum iterations allowed, then display "You may not ask any more questions!" and end the program displaying "END OF PROGRAM" 

The "getAnswer" function should receive the text of the question the user said they wanted to ask.  
If the question begins with the word "Who", then store "Who, Who... isn't that a sound an owl makes?" in a message variable. 
If the question begins with the word "What", then store "What is the meaning of life?" in a message variable. 
If the question begins with the word "How", then store " How do you do?" in a message variable. 
If the question does not start with "Who", "What", or "How" then store "I don't know" in a message variable.  
Prepend the value in the message variable with "The Wizard answers: " and send the data back to the statement that called the "getAnswer" function.

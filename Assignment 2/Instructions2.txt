Code and Test a Python program that ...

...  displays "* * Check Education Level* *" at the top of the program then calls a function that checks to see what the user's education level is.

The first thing the function does is prompt the user for their first name.

Now, prompt the user for their education level.  There are four valid answers, HS, BS, MS, and PhD.  
If the user does not enter a valid education level, display a message that indicates that, e.g.  
"Valid education level not entered, please try again" and give the user a chance to try again,
otherwise display a friendly message that says that shows their first name and their education level and end the program.
